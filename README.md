# INVERTED-F-ANTENNA
This repository contains the design and implementation files for an inverted-F antenna (IFA), a compact antenna widely used in wireless communication at UHF and microwave frequencies. The IFA consists of a monopole element running parallel to a ground plane, grounded at one end and fed at an intermediate point. This structure allows for a shorter, space-efficient antenna that can be easily integrated into modern mobile devices and IoT hardware. The design is optimized for efficient impedance matching and can be adapted for various frequency bands, including 2.4 GHz for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth applications
